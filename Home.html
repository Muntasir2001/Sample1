				<h2 cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" class="h2">What is a computer?</h2>
				<p class="p1"> Computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.</p>

				<p class="p1">Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.</p>

				<h2 cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" class="h2">The first computing device</h2>
				<p class="p2"><strong>Charles Babbage</strong>, an English mechanical engineer and polymath, originated the concept of a programmable computer. Considered the "father of the computer",[17] he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible. The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom. For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later. The Engine incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow in the form of conditional branching and loops, and integrated memory, making it the first design for a general-purpose computer that could be described in modern terms as Turing-complete.[18][19]</p>

				<p class="p2">The machine was about a century ahead of its time. All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand â€“ this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts. Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding. Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow. Nevertheless, his son, Henry Babbage, completed a simplified version of the analytical engine's computing unit (the mill) in 1888. He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.</p>

				<h2 cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer" class="h2">Analog computers</h2>
				<p class="p3">During the first half of the 20th century, many scientific computing needs were met by increasingly sophisticated analog computers, which used a direct mechanical or electrical model of the problem as a basis for computation. However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers.[20] The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872. The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration using wheel-and-disc mechanisms, was conceptualized in 1876 by James Thomson, the brother of the more famous Lord Kelvin.[16]</p>

				<p class="p3">The art of mechanical analog computing reached its zenith with the differential analyzer, built by H. L. Hazen and Vannevar Bush at MIT starting in 1927. This built on the mechanical integrators of James Thomson and the torque amplifiers invented by H. W. Nieman. A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious. By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education (control systems) and aircraft (slide rule).</p>

				<p class="p4">A modern computer is made of hardware and software components. Hardware refers to the part of the computer that has a physical component, such as a keyboard or a mouse, whereas software is any set of instructions that tell the hardware how to accomplish each task.

				Modern computers come in the form of desktop computers and laptop computers. Desktop computers are usually used at work, home, school or the library and are easy to upgrade. Laptop computers, on the other hand, are battery- or AC-powered computers that are more portable than desktop computers, but not as easily upgradeable. Other types of modern computers include tablet computers, mobile phones, game consoles and TVs. One characteristic that all computers have is the ability to share information and files on a network or server.

				According to TechTarget, the idea of a modern computer was conceived following the mathematical ideas of George Boole. The first usable computer began with the vacuum tube and later evolved with the invention of the transistor, which allowed for the production of low-cost personal computers.
